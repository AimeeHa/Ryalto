      <h2>Our Guiding Principles</h2>
      <p>As individuals and engineers, we want to control our destiny. We want to make a difference.
        We want to have an impact. We want to enjoy our journeys.

        We work with a great deal of trust and autonomy here at Ryalto. These principles aim to
        capture our individual ideals and the considerations that help guide our processes on a
        daily basis.

        These are our starting point. We should aim to keep them at the heart of everything we do,
        keep these in mind when we're working and reference them when when working together to make
        decisions, to build a better Ryalto.

        As we grow, we'll iteratively improve these principles and we'll do this together.</p>

      <h3>Build Something Beautiful</h3>
      <p>Building things is much more rewarding when what you're creating is beautiful. This refers
        to
        both the UI and the code that you're writing. It's much nicer to test a front end which is
        pleasant to look at. It's much easier to debug code which is clean, well formatted and,
        well,
        beautiful.</p>

      <h3>Keep It Simple</h3>
      <p>One of the hardest challenges in software engineering is to make a complex problem simple.
        Extra effort is needed but, if done at an early stage, it pays dividends in the future.

        We write code for each other (and our future selves). Keeping it simple and tidy means it's
        easier to debug and expand in the future.</p>

      <h3>Ownership</h3>
      <p>Ryalto is ours. We build it, we maintain it, we use it. Let's look after everything around
        us
        and keep things tidy. If you see a piece of litter, pick it up.

        If you see some code that could be improved, a bug that can be fixed, or some docs that can
        be
        enhanced, then take a little time to make it better. If it's too much effort to do there and
        then, or you don't have the expertise, then create a ticket so we can come back to it later.
        Never say “that's not my job."

        Leave the code base cleaner than you found it. Small improvements matter.

        England Rugby)

        “Don't Live with Broken Windows. Fix bad designs, wrong decisions, and poor code when you
        see
        them.” David Thomas and Andrew Hunt, The Pragmatic Programmer, Tip #4
      </p>

      <h3>Open Communication</h3>
      <p>Asking questions and discussing challenges in open channels gives the opportunity for
        everyone
        to contribute. Those with the required expertise can jump in and help if they're able, and
        everyone can learn from the discussion.

        If you disagree with a decision, you should respectfully challenge it. Present evidence and
        reason logically to defend your position. If the chosen course of action is not the one that
        any particular team member might have wanted, they'll still need to join the team effort
        without second guessing it along the way</p>

      <h3>Invest in Ourselves</h3>
      <p> Our most valuable assets are our knowledge, experiences and attitudes. We want to invest
        in
        our shared knowledge portfolio. As such, ½ a day a week is dedicated to growing,
        consolidating
        and sharing our knowledge.

        Learn and be curious. We are never done learning and should always seek to improve
        ourselves.
        Be curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.</p>

      <h3>Communication isn't Easy</h3>
      <p>Communication is hard. Written communication is harder. When most of our communication is
        written, the absence of visual and audible cues can distort the intended meaning. Osmo Wiio
        said, “If communication can fail, it will. If a message can be understood in different ways,
        it will be understood in just that way which does the most harm.”

        Be patient, be kind, assume the best in each other and be open: open to asking questions,
        and
        open to receiving them.</p>

      <h3>Bias for Action</h3>
      <p> Ignore details early on. Shape up the idea, the functionality, the design and the code as
        you
        go along. The right questions to ask will reveal themselves as you work. You'll feel what is
        missing. Get a prototype working ASAP. Make decisions, make mistakes, correct, adapt and
        iterate to improve.

        Keep it small. Keep it simple. Let it happen. - Andrew Hunt</p>

      <h3>It's a problem when it's a problem</h3>
      <p>While it is always worth being aware of potential challenges, we believe in not trying to
        fix
        them early. There is no point building a system that can handle a million concurrent users
        if
        you never make it to a thousand. Make decisions just in time.
      </p>

      <h3>The only way to go fast, is to go well.</h3>
      <p>“There is no trade-off of quality vs. speed in software. There never has been. Low quality
        means low speed. Always. The only way to go fast is to go well.” - Robert C. Martin, Clean
        Architecture (and Twitter)

        Sometimes we do have to move fast and sacrifice some quality, but this will always have
        consequences. A short-term fix is a long-term headache. Think ahead, and don't sacrifice
        long-term value for short-term results. We always aim to write code that is readable and
        high
        quality.

        This is similar to the popular quote attributed to Kent Beck, which importantly should be
        interpreted in relation to a specific task not an overall project, “Make it work, make it
        right, make it fast”.
